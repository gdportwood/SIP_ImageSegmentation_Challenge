# SIP Image Segmentation Challenge

This repo has (or will have) a complete implementation of the paper [Spectral Embedding and Min-Cut for Image
Segmentation](http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~strider/publications/minCutSpec.pdf) for Hyperspectral Images. It includes written in C to perform spectral embedding for hyperspectral images, as well as perform the necessary graph cuts algorithm.
